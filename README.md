# Annual-Aggregated-County-Road-Mileage
The project focuses on analyzing road infrastructure data to gain insights into road mileage distribution, surface types, paving status, and truck route networks across different counties..

 Objectives Achieved:
County-Wise Total Road Mileage:
Created Pivot Tables and Bar Charts showing top counties by total lane miles and centerline miles.

Yearly Trend of Road Development:
Analyzed how total road mileage changed year over year using a Line Chart.

Paved vs. Unpaved Roads Comparison:
Built a Pie Chart showing the percentage of paved and unpaved roads.

Road Surface Type Distribution:
Visualized the types of surfaces (ACP, BST, etc.) used across road networks via Pie Charts.

Truck Route Roads Summary:
Summarized truck routes (Interstate, NHS, Non-NHS) using Pivot Tables and Bar Charts.
